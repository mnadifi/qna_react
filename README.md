# QnA React 

This QnA ReactJS app is based on the PHQ-9 test. Which is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression.
The PHQ-9 incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other leading major depressive symptoms into a brief self-report tool.
